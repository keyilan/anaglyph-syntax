# anaglyph-syntax theme

A light syntax theme based on old anaglyph images. 3D Glasses not included.

## Fonts

I recommend getting a font like [Input](http://input.fontbureau.com/) that has a greater number of available weights. Different weights are used extensively in this theme in order to help readability. 

## To-do

I'll continue to work on this and make minor improvements. It started out not too serious but now I've actually started using it as my main light syntax theme.
